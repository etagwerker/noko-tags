# Noko Tags

A simple script to remove a bunch of tags from Noko (except a few)

## Setup

Enter your API key to the .env file.

Then: 

```
bundle install
```

## Execute

Check the tags in the main.rb file and make sure those are the ones you want to keep:

```
bundle exec ruby main.rb
```

**WARNING: THIS WILL DELETE ALL TAGS EXCEPT THE ONES IN THE EXCEPTIONS LIST**
